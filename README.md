# Wizzard
Game Development Platform from Subsystems

The Wizzard is a 3x3 Neopixel game development system with switches for each light and three control switches. There is also a speaker for sound output. It is programmed via a JTAG port (no serial programming is available).

This repository has the schematic, sample software, and an STL file for a cover that allows easy use of the buttons and difusses the lights.
